With my current love of overlanding, rebuilding an FC-170, and love of open source, I really wanted to start a central area (repository) for people to publish things they have designed and used in their overland trips for others to use. 

Most of the time I've spent between trips to actually work on the drivetrain of the FC, I am planning. You can find me drawing on graph paper or editing pictures of my truck to see if certain ideas could work. I'm contantly researching new materials to make things lighter, stronger and easier to setup. I figured that other people are also doing the same thing, and I want to help those people out by open sourcing my designs, and giving them a place to put their designs (whether they are modifications of others or originals doesn't matter). 

I do hope that this [repository](https://github.com/betsythefc/OpenOverland/) becomes a big help to the community, and I will be open sourcing my own designs for feedback and contribution. 

On top of that I also plan to post my favorite submissions on this blog to increase some of the visibility. Happy drawing!

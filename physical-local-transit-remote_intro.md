## The 4 stages

When it comes to protecting your data, all of it, there are 4 main categories to protect:

+ Physical
+ Local
+ In transit
+ Remote

I'm going to be writing a 4 part series (starting with this article) covering each of these categories.

## Physical

The physical protection of data means to do 2 things:

+ Protect your data from prying eyes
+ Protect your data from those with physical access to the machine

Prying eyes are everywhere. Not to be too paranoid, but there are a lot of people out, let's say, in coffee shops that just tend to look around, and your laptop screen is full of ripe information for the picking.

> Alice likes coffee, and she regularly works remotely from a coffee shop.

Welcome back Alice. Let's look at how Alice works in a public place and see what pointers can be given and products can be used to help her with her physical data security.

> Alice opens her laptop up and connects right up to the company VPN. She is sitting in a table in the middle of the room working away. There are people all around her, and everyone behind her can see her laptop screen and what she is typing.

What Alice is doing is very standard behavior for those that work remotely from cafes, but what can Alice do to stop those behind her from seeing her screen? Well, Alice can try finding a spot against a wall so that nobody can sit behind her. This is an easy and more importantly, free method of making sure those _prying_ eyes can't get a glimpse of her super secret communiques with Bob. 

Alternatively, if all of the seats facing the wall are taken, then one thing she can do is to purchase a [privacy screen](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dcomputers&field-keywords=privacy+screen). These are thin pieces of plastic that limit the viewing angle of the computer screen to only a few degrees directly in front of the screen. These screens (which I use) make it very difficult for people to see what is on the screen. They also make privacy screen protectors for most major cell phone models.

I always recommend privacy screens because, for laptops, they make no difference in the daily usage of a single user. Cell phone privacy screens have a drawback: they make the screen much darker than normal, so that on my phone the max brightness isn't enough for use in direct sunlight.

> Alice purchased a privacy screen and sits in her normal spot, as usual. People can't spy on her screen anymore and that makes the Charlie-busting messages to Bob much easier to type. 

Another easy and cheap method for Alice to protect her privacy is to cover up her webcam. Most laptops nowadays come with webcams built in. The easy and cheap way to do this is to take a piece of painters or duct tape over the webcam. This makes it a bit difficult if Alice plans on using her webcam regularly. However, there is a solution (go capitalism!). [Webcam covers](https://www.amazon.com/Family-Pack-3-1-0-Black/dp/B00HPC66U4/ref=sr_1_6?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1488763069&sr=1-6&keywords=webcam+cover) are very cheap stick-on plastic doors that can slide open to let your webcam work and slide closed to cover that pesky privacy invader.

> Alice now has left the coffee shop and has boarded the local train to head into the office. She has a privacy on her phone, but still needs to keep an eye on her phone. 

Phones are stolen all the time, sometimes right out of your hand. But Alice is smarter than those phone stealing miscreants, and she has a [wrist strap](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdompro-Colorful-Lanyard-Keychains-Portable/dp/B00LIQCO8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1488763349&sr=1-3&keywords=phone+wrist+strap). If anyone tries to take the phone from her, it is attached to her wrist and will be more difficult to get away.

Alice is pretty protected for now from her physical items being taken when in public, and from information on her screen being jotted down by a creepy guy behind her in a coffee shop. But, Alice, there is much more to do to ensure your data is safe _from Charlie_.

title: A quick PineBook review

Most people own a laptop of some kind. I have 3 currently:

+ Work Macbook Pro
+ Personal HP Envy
+ Pinebook

Everyone knows what a Mac is, and most people have heard of HP. But what the heck is a Pinebook?

A pinebook is a laptop developed by a company, pine64, who build a competitor to the famous RaspberryPi, a small single board computer, that uses the same types of components you would normally find in an android smartphone.

My first exposure to pine64 was buying one of the starter sets that currently hosts this blog. It funnily enough sits on top of my PS4 at home.

But then they came out with the pinebook. A pine64 powered laptop. I purchased the 11.6" version. There were a bunch of things that really drew me to this machine. 

For a while I have been looking for a laptop that is really cheap, that is really light, and good enough for basic workloads, like email and social media. Even the cheapest of laptops came with intel or AMD processors, and although powerful, this made them heavier than I wanted. The pinebook is 89$ for the 11.6" model, and 99$ for the 14" model. Both are the same as far as specs, a quad core, 64-bit ARM cpu and 2GB of RAM. 

I've been using it for a while and I am overall pretty impressed with it, if you use it properly.

Most people who have bought computers themselves before know that, compared to standard laptops, this is an anemic system. But I didn't buy this computer to play League, or do heavy code development, but to go on the internet, store some music and read/respond to my email. And it does just that, very well.

By default, the system comes with Ubuntu, a popular linux distribution. I plan to install the parent to Ubuntu, Debian, on there, as well as get some upgrades to the hardware like expanding the storage. On top of that, because of the limited memory capacity this has, I will be moving to a lighter weight software package.

But even without all the work I want to do to make this a marginally faster machine, it handles web browsing like a champ. Don't like linux? There's a version of android you can install as well, that works with all the android apps you have on your phone, which for 99% of people, is perfect, and for 89$ is cheaper than most tablets, and has a very nice keyboard.

Obviously the pinebook is not for everyone, hell it isn't for most people. I use this as a daily driver for personal web browsing and it works great.

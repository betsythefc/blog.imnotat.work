I'm generally considered a rather paranoid person because of the level of mistrust I place in anything I don't have control over. I employ encryption wherever possible, and I move my private data either to self-hosted solutions or to companies that use encryption that utilizes my own keys so they cannot read what I store.

I also, in general, distrust all government agencies to safely and securely handle data they collect about me. But thinking along these lines, I have no idea what the government knows about me. So I dug a little, and found FOIA. FOIA is the *F*reedom *o*f *I*nformation *A*ct that allows anyone to query gonvernmental organizations for information about themselves (you typically can't place a FOIA request for another person).

So, here are the agencies, according to the [FOIA website](https://www.foia.gov/report-makerequest.html) that I can make FOIA requests against.

- U.S. Agency for International Development
- Department of Agriculture
- Department of Energy
- Department of Education
- Department of Commerce
- Department of Defense
- Department of Health and Human Services
- Department of Homeland Security
- Department of Housing and Urban Development
- Department of Interior
- Department of Justice
- Department of Labor
- Department of State
- Department of Transportation
- Department of the Treasury
- Department of Veterans Affairs
- Environmental Protection Agency
- General Services Administration
- Nationa Aeronautics and Space Administration
- National Science Foundation
- Nuclear Regulatory Commission
- Office of Personnel Management
- Small Business Administration
- Social Security Administration
- Council on Environmental Quality
- Office Management and Budget
- Office of National Drug Control Policy
- Office of Science and Technology Policy
- Office of Unides States Trade Representative

Barring stuff that would be embarressing to post publicly, I'll post here anything I find interesting in the governments report on me.

I simultaneously hope the US government gets an F and an A on the book report of me.

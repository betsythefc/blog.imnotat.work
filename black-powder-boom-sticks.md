Title: Black powder boom sticks

Contradictions are found throughout life. I for one am a strong proponent of logical and effective gun control, but I would be lying if I said I dislike guns.

In fact I own 3 guns:
*Pietta black powder revolver
*1893 double barrel shotgun
*Kentucky rifled musket

One thing you may notice (if you know what guns these have) is that they are all black powder firearms. Black powder is a chemical propellent that was used in the first guns ever made, and it was the prmimary bullet propellent until the lat 1800s. Modern guns use "smokeless powder" which is much more powerful.

My firearms interest is based in the antiquated. I also have a personal goal of only owning guns that do not require an FFL to transfer, and this limits my options to mostly antiques (pre-1895).

>[Decentralization:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority.

Generally speaking, I think decentralization is a good thing. Things like the electrical grid, and internet service.

#Mesh networks

As it stands, you (the consumer) pay an ISP (Internet Service Provider) for access to the internet. Because you pay a single central authority, that single central authority has full authority to restrict, censor, monitor and track your internet usage. That list alone should be cause for concern for most people, but there are other, less "tinfoil hat" and more practical reasons to be worried. 

If an ISP is having problems with their infrastructure, that can adversly affect your internet connection.

There is a solution to this, called mesh networks. Mesh networks aren't mature enough, and frankly I only know about them conceptually. They aren't wide spread enough to be an effective solution, and unlike tor (the onion router), physical location matters in mesh networks.

This is a mesh network, albeit a very simple one. Notice how any of the nodes (the green dots) are connected to multiple other nodes, in that if any of the other green dots in between the top and the bottom node were to disappear, both of the nodes would still have multiple routes to connect to each other. 

This is the important part of mesh networks, that there is no single point of failure to allow any single entity the ability or authority to revoke your access to the internet.

There is a very simple way to create a very simple mesh network. Are your friends with your neighbor? Good. 

You and your neighbor can exchange WiFi passwords. If your network goes down, you can hop on their wireless network, and they can do the same if their network goes down. Now this isn't an automatic switch (like the goal of most mesh networks), but it allows a layer of redundancy to your current network infrastructure.

In an ideal mesh network, there would be many nodes, with multiple nodes having direct connections to the internet (through ISPs). In this ideal mesh network, no single person not paying their bill, nor any network infrastructure failures would cause any of the users in the mesh network to lose internet connectivity.

Now that is an ideal mesh network, and if it is setup properly gives your network redundancy and no entity control over your internet access.

#The electrical grid

The electrical grid is one of the most fickle infrastructure systems we rely on today. Although it is marginally decentralized with power substations located outside most major metropolitan areas, if one of these substations is damaged (due to natural disaster, or attack) then the power grid for most of that area would go down as well. This is another area I advocate maximum decentralization of not only energy storage, but energy production. 

The easiest way to start to create a decentralized power grid, is to install solar on your homes roof. Make sure that the solar is wired to your house's grid first, then to the main grid, as if that goes down you want the solar panels to run your house. 

The next step would be to set up a large battery bank, like the Tesla Power walls that sit in between your solar panels and your homes grid. This ensures the power generated during the day can be used during the night. 

Solar isn't always the best choice in your area, you might not have enough sunny days. I would still recommend a battery bank that sits in between the main grid and your home. Some other ways are to install a multi-fuel generator. Some run on diesel (bio included), some on petrol, propane and natural gas. I don't really advocate running fossil fuel generators except in an emergency, I would also love a hydrogen fuel cell generator, if I can find any available.

>Sets tinfoil hat on head.

Now this distributed electrical grid still uses most of the in-place main power grid. If one house's power goes down, the rest of the solar, wind and generater made electriciy would make up the new gap in power, and keep that house powered. This also stops the grid from being a target for ne'er-do-wells, and protects the maximum number of people from EMP (Electromagnetic pulse) that can be released as it's own weapon, and is a dangerous by product of nuclear explosion.

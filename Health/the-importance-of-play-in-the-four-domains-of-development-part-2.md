Research has shown that play has become increasingly important in early education. The amount of play in preschools and infant and toddler programs has decreased as the necessity for play in these programs have increased. Children learn through play, and it is extremely important for all domains of development: physical, emotional, social, and cognitive (Winerman, 2009). In this portion of the series, we will be discussing play in two of the domains of development: social and emotional.

# Background

It has been difficult to clearly define play in its true form. Play has four main characteristics: flexibility, nonliterality, positive affect, and the use of intrinsic motivation (Lillard, Lerner, Hopkins, Dore, Smith, & Palmquist, 2012). Flexibility means that play can happen anywhere at anytime. Nonliterality is when play becomes pretend. Objects often have different uses, or “behaviors lack their usual meaning,” (Lillard et. al., 2015, p 2). Positive affect is shown when the child is smiling or laughing while playing and they are experiencing a positive activity. Lastly, play is recognized when intrinsic motivation, which is otherwise referred to as volunteerism of a certain activity, is used.

# Emotional Development

A study performed in 2013 asked the question of how maternal attachment affects the ability to play and the development of emotional regulation in infants (Crugnola, Gazzotti, Spinelli, Ierardi, Caprin, & Albizzati, 2013). The study examined the behaviors of new mothers and their nine-month-old infants. By observation, the study was able to conclude that mothers with an insecure attachment with their child often had difficulties keeping their child engaged in play. However, mothers who had a secure attachment with their infants found engaging in play a more simplistic activity (Curgnola et. al., 2013). The same conclusion was given when the researchers focused on the infant’s development of self-regulation. The mothers who had an insecure attachment with their infants found that their infants emotions were difficult to regulate. On the other hand, the infants who had a secure maternal attachment had better self-regulatory skills.   

## Maternal Depression

Maternal depression affects the way mothers can engage in positive interactions during play with their child (McFaddin & Tamis-Lemonda, 2013). When maternal depression occurs, it is more likely that the child is not receiving an adequate amount of positive experience and setting up a failure to thrive for the infant as the infant is trying to understand the world around them. Play has been affected by maternal depression because the mothers are less willing to play with their child as they are involved in high maternal sensitivity and depressive behaviors as well as low responsiveness. Mothers who are most likely to be involved in this scenario are that of low income. Usually this is because it is difficult for low income mothers to receive care for their depression (McFaddin & Tamis-Lemonda, 2013). To prove that maternal mental health has an affect on the quality of play, a study was conducted by McFaddin and Tamis-Lemonda (2013). In this study, researches gather 160 young mothers (about 21 years old) and their 15-month-old infants. The study consisted of home visits, which included the video taping of the play interaction between the mother and child, and two assessments: a pre-assessment and a post-assessment. This study concluded that maternal depression was unusually high; 60% of the participants had symptoms of clinical depression. This has an impact on the infants’ cognitive well-being, and the quality of the mother-infant interaction as it relates to play in early childhood (McFaddin & Tamis-Lemonda, 2013).

## Self-Regulation

Play can have many uses while a child is developing their ability to self-regulate their emotions. Rough-and-tumble play can help an infant or toddler calm down from being over stimulated and being loved, cuddled, or doing a quiet activity helps infants and toddlers when they are under-stimulated. A study performed in Japan was conducted to define whether or not rough and tumble play is helpful for self regulation (Nakagawa & Sukigara, 2014). This was a longitudinal study that gave parents questionnaires between the first four months of an infant’s life and the 24th month. There were four different types of questionnaires: infant behavior, early childhood behavior, soothing method, and the type of play (Nakagawa & Sukigara, 2014). Also during this study, Nakagawa and Sukigara (2014) investigates whether the children were preferring to do different activities depending on their moods. Infants and toddlers in a negative state were much more likely to want to be cuddled or be loving by a close caregiver. When infants and toddlers were in a positive state, they preferred to be involved in rough-and-tumble play.

Symbolic and pretend play can be used as a way to understand an event that the child is going through (Sossin & Cohen, 2011). For example, after the terrorist attacks of 2001, a study was conducted to investigate how resilient the children were after losing a family member to the attacks. This was a qualitative study that used video taping of play sessions with the mother, the child, and a therapist. The study found that children who go through a traumatic experience, such as the loss of a loved one, are interested in acting it out in pretend play, or using it as a play theme (Sossin & Cohen, 2011). Children in this study were interested in learning about rescue, death, destruction, risk taking, and more. These play themes are often used to help children comprehend what is happening in their lives (Sossin & Cohen, 2011). This is another way children have used play in order to regulate their emotions.

## Social Referencing

Social referencing refers to the behavior that an infant or a toddler does to confirm that a certain behavior, event, or object is safe. The infants are looking for the caregivers emotional response. This is the behavior of looking back to the caregiver, parent, or sometimes peers for guidance in a certain situation. Infants and toddlers use social referencing to create the rules about this world. They create schemes for how they should respond to a given event. A study by Vaillant-Molina and Bahrick (2012) investigated when infants begin to use social referencing. A multitude of infants were shown two videos. One of the videos was of a mother figure who responded positively to a toy, and the other was of another motherly figure who responded negatively toward a toy. Infants were more likely to copy their respectable videos instead of creating their own scheme about the toy (Vaillant-Molina & Bahrick, 2012). The study was done with infants as young as five and half months old. This study shows us that infants start using social referencing at a very early age and they use it to build schemes throughout their learning processes.

Another study by Nichols, Svetlova, and Brownell (2010) investigated whether or not toddlers were using social referencing to decide what toy to play with. The results showed that toddlers will decrease interest in a certain toy if they know it caused a negative or positive response from another toddler (Nichols, Svetlova, & Brownell, 2010). Social referencing has a big impact in the decisions that toddlers make. They may use social referencing and see a peer hit, bite, or scratch to get what they want. If the experience is a positive one, then the toddler will be inclined to believe that hitting, biting, or scratching is how they could get what they want. Social referencing is very a very powerful behavior, because sometimes caregivers or parents may not be able to control who their toddler references. However, there are many benefits to social referencing such as creating new schemes about the world.

# Social Development

Social development refers to the way children react and interact with others in society. Children can gain social abilities by playing in groups as well as solitary play. During group play, children learn how to work with others. In solitary play, children typically act out an emotional situation in their lives in order to better understand that situation. Five studies were conducted by a team of researchers (Lillard, Lerner, Hopkins, Dore, Smith, and Palmquist, 2015). Two of theses studies were observational. The researchers were watching children playing on the playground and the results showed no correlation because the children might have undeveloped social skills from a different setting. One study was performed in the parental context and also found no correlation between solitary play and social development (Lillard et. al., 2015). Another two studies of this group observed children in a laboratory setting. With this controlled setting, researchers were able to conclude that there was a positive correlation between solitary play and social development (Lillard et. al., 2015).

## Joint Attention

Joint attention is the ability to focus on an object or event that another person is focused on. Two people are paying attention to the same thing. Joint attention can lead to joint social play, which requires the ability of two people to be attending to the same play-based activity. Joint attention can help in the social context as well as the cognitive context. In the cognitive context, the development of attention is a cognitive process. In the social context, joint attention can begin the understanding of how others play and how one could engage in play simply by paying attention. A study conducted by Shin (2012) investigated how infants “engage in playful social interactions based on joint attention and their mutual social understandings” (Shin, 2012, p 4). This study was a qualitative study performed at a child care center for infants and toddlers. Shin gathered information by using video tape observations and infant progression charts (Shin 2012). This study concluded that the use of joint attention during play was very important and well-developed. Infants were pointing to objects as they wanted to share their attention with their peers. This study also concluded that typically developing infants are capable of understanding gestures and body language of their peers. They were able to effectively communicate with each other and continued to comprehend the value of pointing (Shin, 2012).  

## Maternal Responsiveness

Maternal responsiveness refers to the interaction that the mother has with her infant in response to an infant communicative behavior. Maternal responsiveness is important in play because it is good for the infant to social reference the mother. A study by DiCarlo, Onwujuba, & Baumgartner (2014) investigated the quality of maternal response and infant communicative behavior. The objective of this study was to give training to mothers who had a low maternal responsiveness to their child. While the researchers were finding the baseline, they found that more than 50% of mothers had low maternal responsiveness to their infants. During bi-directional play, the mother affects the child the same amount as the child affects the mother (DiCarlo, Onwujuba, & Baumgartner, 2014). If the mother is not responsive when the infant is trying to communicate, the infant will develop low communication skills and even a lack of social skills. After applying the training to the mothers, their responsiveness increased (DiCarlo, Onwujuba, & Baumgartner, 2014).

# Conclusion

Engel, an advocate for playtime in classrooms says, “If we want to create happy children who love learning, forcing them to sit at desks or tables through early childhood is just not going to do it,” (Engel, 2015). Another advocate for play, Raphael-Leff (2012) says that play can be used for a multitude of purposes. Play can be used to process anxiety, compensate for frustration, plan ahead, practice and rehearse, foster inventiveness, and reinforce a sense of cultural belonging (Raphael-Leff, 2012). Play has diminished in infant, toddler, and preschool programs throughout the world. Because of the research presented, play should be reinstated in schools because it is an important factor in physical, emotional, social, and cognitive development.

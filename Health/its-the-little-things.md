# That really piss me off

As most people should know, living with a chronic disease can be a difficult thing to cope with. What most don't see is all the extra baggage we have to carry because of it.

*Oh you thought I meant emotional baggage?*

Well, I kind of do, but today I wanted to rant a bit about the physical bags I have to carry to maintain my Type 1 diabetes.

## You aren't that fat

First, there are 2 types of diabetes:

Type 1
: An auto-immune disease that [destroys cells in your pancreas called beta cells](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes-guide/type-1-diabetes#1).

Type 2
: A person produces the proper amount of insulin, [but their cells don't use it as well as they should. Doctors call this insulin resistance](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/type-2-diabetes#1).

I have Type 1 diabetes. My immune system thinks my pancreas is some foreign body, and promptly attacks it, constantly I might add.

## Stuff to keep with you

When you leave the house, you probably perform the 3-thing pat: phone, wallet, keys.

When I leave the house I do a similar thing, called the 4-thing pat: phone, wallet, keys and insulin pump. My insulin pump is a device that, in my case, keeps a constant check on my blood sugar, and delivers insulin when I tell it to, like when I eat.

It's a small, phone-sized device that I keep on my belt at all times, even when I'm sleeping (minus the belt).

*Well that isn't too bad...*

But that isn't the only thing I have to carry. I also have a pack that I keep with me everywhere. In it is my Glucose tester, sugar pills, emergency syringes, extra reservoirs and infusion sets (like a small IV that goes in my stomach), an insulin vial, extra AA batteries for my pump, my CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor), medical tape, and pills. The kit itself is roughly the size of a piece of printer paper, about 3 inches thick. I have to carry this everywhere I go no matter what.

My biggest complaint so far about all this, despite cursing any higher power I can think of for my condition, is the AA batteries.

I try my best not to waste, and the idea that I have to use AA batteries instead of an integrated battery, similar to my smart phone, that can be charged with a Micro-USB cable really bothers me. I'm currently using rechargeable batteries. This is probably the best sitaution that I can do right now, but it has its flaws. If the batteries aren't at exactly 100% when you put them in the insulin pump, the pump will reject the battery and it won't work until you charge them. This means that I have to keep batteries topped off all the time. This also means I have to carry multiple rechargeable batteries in case, and a non-rechargeable if they all fail. On top of that, I can't top batteries off when I am out in the field or at work, or enjoying my time at the beach, because the chargers I have aren't USB powered. So I have to keep them charged at home, and keep them topped off in my kit.

Why haven't insulin pump manufacturers put Micro-USB ports on the pumps to recharge them? Why do I have to either increase my wastefullness by using one time use batteries, or go with the massive headache of maintaining a small stockpile of rechargeables!

Don't get me wrong, this is low on my list of head-against-the-wall problems I've had with the medical device manufacturers I've encountered. I am writing about it mostly to show: how annoying would it be for you to make sure you always kept 3-4 AA batteries on hand at all times, to keep a life-saving device running, and trying your best to be conscious of your waste?

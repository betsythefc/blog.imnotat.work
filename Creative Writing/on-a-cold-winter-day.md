Title: On a Cold Winter Day
Status: published

The best things are made from scratch.

Soft, warm bread pressed together

Under my fingertips.

Firm, yet delicate.
 

The sweet cinnamon reaches my nose,

Enticing my appetite;

It should not go to waste.

 
Warmth from the crackling fire

Not but four feet away;

This is the moment.

 
Cinnamon, brown sugar and banana

Lay across my taste buds;

They could do no harm.

 
I float upon a cloud of this homemade

Delight; well worth its wait.

The best things are made from scratch.

Title: On a Cold Winter Day

The best things are made from scratch.<br />
Soft, warm bread pressed together<br />
Under my fingertips.<br />
Firm, yet delicate.<br />

The sweet cinnamon reaches my nose,<br />
Enticing my appetite;<br />
It should not go to waste.<br />
 
Warmth from the crackling fire<br />
Not but four feet away;<br />
This is the moment.<br />

Cinnamon, brown sugar and banana<br />
Lay across my taste buds;<br />
They could do no harm.<br />
 
I float upon a cloud of this homemade<br />
Delight; well worth its wait.<br />
The best things are made from scratch.<br />

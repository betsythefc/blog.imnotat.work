title: A not so Scientific Observation

One morning, about 2 weeks ago, I had walked out of my home to drive to work, and noticed that the driver side rear tire was pretty low. Not enough to cause me any concern (as I wasn't going to be driving any faster than 30mph). I thought, "Hey, I always let someone know their tire is low if I see it", I purposefully left the tire low, and drove to work.

To put this into perspective, my commute is typically around 45 minutes in stop and go traffic. I wanted to see if there were other people who would be willing to let me know the tire was low during my commute.

So I head out and drive normally to work. The bottom of the tire was bulging quite a bit, anyone who was behind the car next to me would clearly see the tire and how low it was. 

I was absolutely shocked by how many people pointed it out to me: 0.

After being passed some by some 50+ cars on the way to work, not one of them even looked at my car. In fact I distinctly counted 4 people who looked, and stared for several seconds at my tire, and passed me without looking at me once.

This was actually quite disappointing. I'm generally the kind of person who, if I notice a burnt out tail light, I'll pull up next to the person, roll down the window and let them know. I've done it multiple times.

I re-ran my very unscientific study again on the way home, and got the same result. Now this is clearly not a peer reviewed study, though I would absolutely love to read one, however it does show a certain trend that I've seen with other studies and lots of other anecdotal stories that people in big cities tend to ignore each other. I find this very sad, and I will continue to point out the low tire, broken tail light, or oft-forgotten turn signal.

I also implore anyone reading this to pull over when you see someone on the side of the road, stuck, and lend a hand. Tell that pickup in front of you his tail light is out, and let that nice old woman know she left her right turn signal on.

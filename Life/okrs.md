_Holy incommunicado Batman!_

I know, it's been a long time since my last article, however that is because I am terrible at keeping deadlines!

Hopefully this changes. Where I work, we use a system to help with personal career development, and aligning them with corporate goals. These are called OKRs, or, _Objectives_ and _Key Results_. I've found them rather userful in the professional space, so I though, "what the hell, I'll try them personally". 

# What is an Objective?
Most people can guess this one but I want to be clear on what makes a good Objective.

A good objective is one that can be broken down into very vclearly defined _Key Results_.

For example, I can have the following objective: "Learn Basic Python"

Typically OKRs are on some kind of time-table, at work we run them quarterly.

# Key results

A _Key Result_ is like a KPI, _Key Performance Indicator_. 

A Key result should be A clearly defined milestone that is easily evidenced and easy to understand.

Taking our example above, here is what that OKR might look like:

* Learn Basic Python
 * Read Chapter 1 of "Python for Dummies".
 * Completed practice scripts in Chapter 1 of "Python for Dummies".
 * Re-write a previous basic Bash shell script in Pythong (Bash being another scripting language I know well)

The 3 Key results above are easy to understand, and can be definitively marked as complete with stark evidence that they have been completed. This is important. For example you wouldn't want a Key Result to say "Study Python" because it doesn't list how long to study, what to study and how you know that the studying has been effective.

Why bring this up now? One of my OKRs for this Quarter (ending at the end of September), is to increase the amount of articles I write. As it stands, I want to write a single article per week, and I have each week through September as a key result. This is the first Key Result that I can actually cross off my list.

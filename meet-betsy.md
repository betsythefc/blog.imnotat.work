## Meet Betsy, my FC-170.
A while ago I purchased a 1959 Jeep FC-170. These trucks are pretty rare and have seen an upsurge in popularity recently because of the debut of the _Mighty FC_ at the Easter Jeep Safari several years ago (2014 I think). That is when I fell in love with the cab over style and "pug-face" of the FC.

I got into Overlanding and offroading pretty late in life, at 18 when I purchased my first car: a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I picked up the car in Santa Cruz and drove her home over 17, on completely bald tires. I spent the majority of that night using Google to absorb what the _Jeep culture_ was, and since then I have been hooked. Now that 95 ZJ is long since gone (RIP Hercules), 

I do admit that I am a bit of a fanboy with Jeeps, though not to the detriment of other makes and models (I respect all those vehicles that wish to overland and offroad). 

Betsy was an impulse buy of mine. After researching FCs and keeping an eye out on Craigslist, I found the perfect truck, a mere 12 hour drive from where I lived. I called the owner up, and we agreed to meet. I couldn't take time off of work, so I had it planned to leave on a Friday and be back on a Sunday. We left Friday night, after work, and made our way up to Portland.

I felt that it was fate for me to get Betsy, and that superstitious feeling solidified when upon we found "Betsy + Greg" scrolled on the side of the included camper shell. This was significant to us, as we had settled on the name Betsy far before picking her up, and _Greg_ is the name of my late father, who at this point had only recently passed away.

My plans for Betsy are numerous, and in a continous state of flux. Currently, we are putting in a Chevy 350 (that famous V8) as the powerplant and keeping the stock 3 speed manual transmission and 2 speed transfer case. The 350 was recently painted and I am awaiting some parts, like the water pump, to finish it up. Then on to the rest of the drvietrain!

I hope to have Betsy driving this year (2017), and outfitted for the overland adventures I, and my friends, have planned soon after.

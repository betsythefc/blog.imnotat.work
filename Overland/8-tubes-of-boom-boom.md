Progress on a project is always accompanied by a great feeling of satisfaction.

This last week I made some big progress on Betsy.

That's right, the beating heart of this unique offroad machine is the venerable Chevy 350. This engine was sourced from a 1975 Corvette (and subsequently I will be putting period correct Corvette badges under the FC-170 badges). The engine is now freshly rebuilt and painted red to match the pretty dress up kit I bought from Summit Racing. 

I still need to purchase the pulleys and water pumps but soon it will be ready to drop onto the frame.

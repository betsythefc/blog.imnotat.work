Every project, especially those on a budget, have lulls in activity because of the budget. I am in the middle of one of these lulls as I wait to save some money for the next batch of parts. In these "valleys", I spend my time agonizing over small design details and building my overall plan for Betsy. The main plan I have been re-architecting is the sleeping platform in the bed of the truck.

My original idea involved using 2x4 support struts to span the width of the bed, like below.

Then I would have a custom built plywood top to cover the gaps and make a solid sleeping area:

This is a decent design (in my humble opinion) but I ran into a few issues:

+ The support beams on the side of the bed, which I will be using to mount the platform, won't snugly fit the 2x4 supports, so there will be wiggle throughout the frame.
+ Storing the 2x4 mounts in the fashion shown in the picture above would require an over-engineered solution that is unsightly and space innefficient
+ The overall platform weight would be very heavy (>50lbs)
+ The solution is cost ~250$ to implement

Arguably the last point is a pro, as it seems inexpensive, however if I can build it for cheaper without comprimising strength, it'll make the wallet a little happier.

My current design, solves all of these problems::

This uses [webbing straps](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-in-Black-Webbing-Strap-810146/204808177) to create a crossed "X" pattern that will mount to some anchors in the support beams of the bed. The webbing strap will connect to a [ratchet strap](http://www.homedepot.com/p/EVEREST-1-in-x-6-ft-Ultra-Ratchet-Tie-Down-Strap-with-1500-lbs-S-Hook-2-Pack-U1001-2/203573972) at the end that will allow me to tighten the slack of the webbing strap so it is taut. 

Because the webbing strap will be a single length that is "woven" to the anchors (and it will be doubled up to increase stength), The storage for the bed platform will be as small as the webbing and ratchet strap can be rolled up. I am still looking for ways to make a folding platform to go on top of the webbing, similar to the old design.

This kind of planning is very exciting to me, although the execution date is not set and very far off, and not high on the priority list, it is something I can do in my free time, when I don't have access to things like the engine or transmission on a daily basis.

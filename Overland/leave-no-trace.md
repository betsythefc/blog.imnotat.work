In the offroading, camping, hiking, and general outdoor communities, there is the philosophy of "Leave No Trace". 

Leave No Trace is an ethical outdoor "rulebook" that keeps the outdoors, whether it be a national park or deep woods camping, open and wild. We don't want animals in wild places to become accustomed to humans, and we don't want to cover a campground in trash.

The [7 principles](https://lnt.org/learn/seven-principles-overview) of Leave No Trace (LNT) are:

1. Plan Ahead and Prepare
2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces
3. Dispose of Waste Properly
4. Leave What You Find
5. Minimize Campfire Impacts 
6. Respect Wildlife
7. Be Considerate of Other Visitors

> "The Principles are based not only on a respect for nature and other visitors, they are also based on and supported by scientific research." 

It is incredibly important that we follow the above guidelines when overlanding. We want to continue overlanding, we want others to enjoy nature, we want the wild to remain wild. So when you are planning your next camping trip, hiking adventure, or overland expedition, please remember to LNT.

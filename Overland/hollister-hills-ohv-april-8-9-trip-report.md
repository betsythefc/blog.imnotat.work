Welcome to the very first overland trip report of our fair group. This last weekend we went to the [Hollister Hills State Recreational Vehicle Area (SVRA) park](http://www.ohv.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1179) for a day of offroading and a night of camping.

#Hitting the trails

>Bryce: We got to the campsite around 11:30am on Saturday, and because of some recent rains we found it pleaseantly empty. After we staked our claim to the site (by setting up a cheap tent and securing it to the picnic table with some bungie cords) Nick and I decided to head out to the trails while we waited for Sam to get there. Directly in front of our campsite (Sycamore camp) was the opening to a small hill climb to get to Mc Cray and Foothill trails. 

>That's where the fun started.

>Bryce: Because my 1959 FC-170 is still getting re-powered and restored, I opted to bring my 2004 Jeep WJ (Grand Cherokee, Limited, 4.7L V8) on the trip as a backup vehicle. She is my daily driver. I attempted the "hill climb" first, and I must say that bald street tires, good traction does not make. 

>Because of the recent rain fall, I slipped and slid all over that climb and couldn't get up, so I backed down and went around to the nice dry, less than 45 degree incline trail next to it that met at the top.

>(Insert Nick's attempt at hill climb here)

>Bryce: And during Nick's sliding around, Sam shows up! Right on time to show us how it's done.

>(Insert Sam's successful attempt to go up the first little hill)

>(Insert Nick's successful attempt to get up the hill)

>Bryce: So there you go, we are up on the little hill (mind you the "hill is ~15-20 feet tall) but still. 

>Bryce: Sam is leading the pack, with me playing caboose. We continue up the hill to get to the main trails (Mc Cray and Foothill) where Sam's rearend slips and ends up half off the trail. The mud is everywhere.

##Oh god, the mud

>(Insert Sarah on how she get stuck.)

>Bryce: Although we are pretty new to offroading, we are wiser than the first time we went out. Nick and I actually brought tow straps (that story's for another day). Since I was pulling rear guard, I got out to assess the situation, see if I could help. Half way between Rocky (Nick's Daihatsu Rocky) and Topaz (Sam's Jeep XJ), my cheap cleat-style shoes met the most wonderful mud, resulting in the entirety of my chest, hands, lower legs and knees covered in it. I was able to get back up, only to be comically pulled back down to the moist ground; twice. Once stabilizing myself on Sam's truck I was able to get a bearing (lol) on the situation.

>(Insert Nick on trying to help but slipping everywhere)

>(Insert footage of Nick from dash cam)

>Bryce: We then realize that Sam isn't in 4 wheel drive! But alas, things can't be that simple, as the linkage to her transfer case (the cable that connects the interior handle to the actual shifter on the transfer case) couldn't be installed because a hard rubber grommet was in the way. The only way to shift into 4x4? Get under the truck with a wrench and manually activate it.

>So we did. Nick took a look first, then I got under there and couldn't move it by hand. Anthony also tried and failed, but both him and I did succeed at covering the other half of clothes in mud.

>And to our rescue comes Gabriel. Gabe is driving an early 2000's (complete guess) Ford Explorer, and he sees us from the top of the hill. He happily backs down, connects our tow straps to his truck and yanks Sam back onto the trail.

>Once she is free, both Nick and I see on the other side of the hedges bordering this tough area, is a nice and easy to navigate, dry, trail going to the same place at the top, right next to us. So we back down and opt to take that.

>(Insert Nick's attempt to go up the muddy area before surrendering)

>Bryce: Gabe generously offers to ride with us, if we can get Sam into 4x4. So Anthony and I get to work, climbing under Topaz again (did she have to park in a muddy spot up top?) to try and shift into 4-low. After 10 or so minutes, and a crescent wrench, we got her into 4-low where she stayed for the rest of the night.

#Heat is bad for engines.

>Bryce: Off we go! We took Foothill trail towards the obstacle course for the next round of fun, where I, leading the way this time, immediately got stuck in a dug out water hole by accident (because I didn't see it) and having to be pulled, ass-backwards, by Nick (thanks bud).

>I decided to park the WJ off to the side and let Nick and Sam take a few laps and have some fun. Turkey (my WJ) was really only there as a backup/recovery truck anyway.

>(Insert Sarah & Nick about lap around obstacle course with Gabe)

>Bryce: After taking a bathroom break, Gabe invited us to run some trails with him. We gladly accepted, after ensuring the WJ would be good enough on those trails and that mud was down to a minimum. Gabe volunteered for scouting duties and took off to survey the fun ahead. 

>He returned with good news, the trails were dry! Here comes the next adventure.

>Rocky was overheating when we reached a nice flat quarry like area. Popping the hood, Nick had found the electric fan wasn't powering on.

>(Insert Nick on heat problems)

>Bryce: I brought my test light over to figure out: was it the fan or the sensor? (Hint: it was the sensor). Well we aren't going to leave Rocky, and Nick, stranded here while AAA comes through to get him. We needed to get Rocky back on the road for the sake of the trip.

>(Insert pictures from Sarah on us repairing Rocky)

>Bryce: I came up with the idea to hotwire the fan directly to the battery to it was always on, and it was as good a plan as any. With some wire cutters and a roll of electrcial tape, we had Rocky cooling down in no time.

>(Insert any photos of the repair)

>Bryce:Gabe struck out ahead of us to see if the trails were still okay to run for little stock Turkey and her bald street tires; they were, so we continued.

>Generally speaking the next few miles were pretty uneventful.

>(Insert any eventful stories here)

>Bryce: I was getting low on gas (1/4 tank) and figured with Gabe, dry trails, and a more experienced group overall (because of that morning) I could retire to the campsite to play my role as camp manager (or camp momma if you prefer). We all headed back and Gabe left to run a few more trails and wait for us.

#Setting up camp

>Bryce: Camp setup was pretty simple. Sam typically sleeps in her XJ, with an amazingly comfortable looking futon mattress

>(insert Topaz sleeping area pictures)

>Bryce: Nick was planning on sleeping in his military style pup tent, but he forgot to bring the stakes, so he borrowed my tent, and my nephew Joey opted to sleep in a hammock (for the first time).

>(Insert pics of hammock and Joey sleeping in it)

>Bryce: Gabe came by to say goodbye; he was leaving for the day. We thanked him profusely for saving our asses and hanging with us for a trail run.

>(Nick & Sarah on Egyptian war)

>Bryce: Anthony was able to get a fire started (with some difficulty, as everything was wet) and Nick and him set out to cut up some of the dead branches for kindling and logs to keep it burning. It was starting to get cold. 

>(Nick, Sarah on Bullshit)

>Bryce: Nick, Sam and Joey all wanted to get another trail run in for the evening before retiring so they took off.

>(Insert trail run here)

#Back at camp

>Bryce: Anthony and I hung around camp, got some logs, and began drying them out. There was another pair of guys at the campground hanging out around a diesel heater (usually used in vineyards). They offered us some deisel to keep the fire going, and we did take them up on that offer, using it throughout the evening to get a nice hot fire going to keep us warm; it was getting very cold.

>Nick, Sam and Joey got back, and Nick asked me if I wanted to learn stick. Yes I know, I don't know how to drive a manual, but that's why I need to start learning, and on what better a vehicle than a death-trap like Rocky. I'm proud to say that I only stalled it (something like) 18/20 times and was successfully able to shift into 1st gear while pointing uphill.

##Dinner

>Bryce: Joey and I were in charge of dinner for the night and we had brough the makings of burgers. Although he is 12, he is pretty good at making them, so while I set up camp some more, he was chef. With some terrible (and I mean they were really bad) BBQ chips to hold us over until the food was cooked, Nick and Anthony hacked away at branches and a large wooden plank to keep the fire going. 

##Winding down

>Bryce: Night fell pretty quickly, and the (relatively drunk) campers who offered us diesel also offered us some beer, and I'll be damned if I don't accept from free beer and some free warmth from that diesel heater. We all chatted for a bit before Joey retired to the hammock, and I decided to get some reading done. I was sleeping in the back of the WJ.

>(Insert WJ sleeping picture)

>Bryce: I don't know how late they stayed up talking to the other campers (whom I think one was named Paul, but I am terrible with names), but I was out by the time they did come back to camp. 

###Sleeping in the WJ

>Bryce: I do have to say that sleeping in the back of the WJ (I'm 6'1") wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, though I now know if I ever wanted to do it again, I would need a very thick foam pad (like 6" thick) to stay comfortable. Joey also learned that hammocks are cold to sleep in.

>Joey and I had to leave in the morning ~8am to make some obligations, but Nick and Sam stayed after and did some more trail fun.

##The after runs

>(Insert run after I left)

#Conlusion

>Bryce: Hollister Hills is such a fun place to offroad and camp. I'm sure even when Betsy is complete and we've done some serious overland trips that we will all be coming back here multiple times for easy trails (and hard ones) and some good camping. It's hard to beat the price (10$ a night as of this writing) and the access; only 45 minutes from San Jose.

>Nick: 

>Sam:

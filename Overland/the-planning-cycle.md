For the past 2 weeks, I have been home, recovering from a dislocated kneecap (which by the way wasn't even accompanied with a good story). With so much time on my hands, I naturally have been obsessing over my beautiful truck. With the drive train already planned to a tee, I have been turning my attention to the trucks aesthetics at the campsite and on the trail. 

I'm currently on the 3rd iteration of the sleeping platform design, where I have been fighting 3 major components to find a good compromise:

- Overall weight
- Ease of construction
- Ease of setup

These are pretty common components that go into sleeping platforms. Through my research I have found many sleeping platforms that rely on a full wooden construction, where all of the weight bearing is done internally, and it ends up as a self contained box that I would sleep atop. Although this works so well in modern pickup trucks and SUVs, and for 90% of overland campers, having to store a massive box outside of the truck during my not-camping time (I know, such a terrible thought), I wanted a more compact solution.

My first full design included 3 cross beam 2x4 studs that would mount to the top of the pickup bed of the FC, where a plywood sheet would go across to create the hard surface to sleep on. All storage underneath would be in bins, and when it's packed away, it would be a much smaller footprint. I still had to contend with the weight, which overall was over 100lbs. That seemed too heavy for me, and actually setting it up at the campsite would be difficult to get it secure. This idea needed work.

My second iteration completely scrapped the first idea, and went super light weight. The main platform still supported a piece of plywood for the surface, but instead of a 2x4 support structure, I thought rope would be a good idea. I would use a long piece of strong rope to connect between the sides of the pickup bed to form a web or mesh shape for the support. This made actual setup more complicated, but the construction complexity would be near 0 and the weight total would be closer to 40lbs instead of the original 100lbs.

But of course, with too much time on my hands, I wanted to get rid of the plywood on top altogether to get the weight down more, and to keep storage space requirements at a minimum. So, back to the drawing board. 

The current design, is my favorite, and it has the best compromises in my opinion. Instead of a plywood "floor", I opted for a canvas floor, along the lines of a cot. I would stretch the canvas between 2 wooden poles, which would slide into some loops that are connected to hooks on the outside of the truck. This makes setup very easy, the weight low, the overall construction simple, and the storage footprint reasonable. In fact, I can build the storage into the pickup bed, so I never have to store it outside the truck, even if I am only doing a trail run, or using the truck as a truck (hauling, etc). 

I even mocked up the entire rear of the truck, with electrical, storage, sleeping platform, and tent in 3d software. I mostly use it to stare and drool idly at my dream while I am bed-bound. 

I am pleased with the design, as of right now, but I do keep other ideas in the back of my mind, and hell, I'm so far from actually building the overland section of this truck, that it is safe (and fun) to redesign.

All of this work may seem a bit overkill, but there are some things to remember. One, planning is fun for me. I love designing and blueprinting, and 3d modeling, to get a representation of what I want. Secondly, I want to be meticulous in these designs. I will be sleeping on this platform for maybe weeks at a time. It must be comfortable. I will be packing it up and deploying it several times a week on longer overland trips, so I need it to be easy to set up. This must be simple to build, as that means, simple to repair. And also, because of who I am, it must be unique. Thirdly, I have the time to design and play with these ideas.

There have been some other updates about my project that I hope to be writing about soon, so keep checking in.

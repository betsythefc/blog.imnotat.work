Ah, the venerabke XJ. The favorite of budget-friendly drivers, and mod-happy offroaders alike.

## Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)
The history of the Cherokee starts back in the 1960s, with the introduction of the Jeep Wagoneer. The SJ is claimed to be the worlds first "SUV", and came in 2 main varieties: a 4 door and a 2 door. In 1974, AMC resurrected the 2 door model of the Wagoneer, christening it the "Cherokee". Soon after, AMC also released the "Grand Wagoneer", creating the "Grand" dichotomy, dictating the standard and "luxury" models of Jeeps.

These Jeeps shared the same body-on-frame style as the Jeep pickup trucks of the same vintage. 

## Jeep Wagoneer (XJ)
The first XJ came with the name Wagoneer, but was the same familiar unibody construction and general shape what we have come to love in the XJ, except for the odd front clip. The XJ Wagoneer was produced from 1983 - 1990, and in 1993, the Grand Wagoneer, in the form of the new ZJ (Grand Cherokee) was built in 1993.

The XJ, under the name "Cherokee", was released alongside the "Wagoneer" of the same body type in 1983, and continued to 2001. These trucks were incredibly reliable, with pricing in reach of most families, and quickly rose to popularity. Parts are available everywhere, inexpensively, and auto-wrecker yards are filled with XJ's looking to be parted out from their rusty destiny.

## Jeep Liberty (KJ)
For any Americans reading this article, you may not need know that for the world market, outside of the US, the KJ was named "Cherokee", and only in the US was it named the "Liberty". In a lot of offroad forums, many Jeep enthusiasts will insist the the entire Cherokee line, after the XJ are "not real Jeeps". I dislike this attitude, and there are many good examples of modern Cherokee's running circles around other Jeeps.

## Jeep Liberty (KK)
This Jeep branded Dodge Nitro is the second generation following the Jeep Commander, Jeeps only 3-row seating option. 

## Jeep Cherokee (KL)
The most modern Jeep Cherokee, has been entirely re-designed from the ground up. The trail-hawk trim of this model is a formidable trail runner.

## Notes
Though every one of these Jeeps, except the XJ, have a lack of aftermarket support and generally speaking are not very trail ready when stock.

I've been thinking about ways to broach the subject of firearms on this blog. There is a lot of political charge around guns, especially recently, and I don't really want to make these posts about politics or idealogies. 

As liberal as I am, I do enjoy firearms and heavily support _smart_ gun regulations. With that, let's dig into the kinds of firearms I own and prefer.

## An old classice, just like me...
My preferred vintage of firearms covers the entire 19th century, into World War 1. At the start of the 1800s, we saw what firearms had been for 200 years or so, where the shooter had to poor powder and ball into the front of the gun (muzzle) and press them down with a rod of some sort. These are called 'muzzleloaders' for that reason. The 1800s were a serious time of innovation in most areas of life including firearms. The first repeating arms (firearms that you didn't have to reload after every shot) were introduced: The Revolver. I have 2 reproduction civil war era revolving handguns: The Confederate 1851 Navy Colt, and the Union 1858 New Army Remington. I do not purchase firearms as wall hangers, so these of course are in good working order and shoot well.

Both of these revolvers are incredibly fun to shoot, however unlike modern revolvers, the reloading process is much closer to the muskets of yester-century than today: I poor powder into each of the 6 chambers in the cylinder, and press a ball into the chamber. I then put ignition caps on the back, which the hammer strikes to fire the charge. Both of these handguns produce loads of smoke. Why? Because black powder.

## Black Powder
Most people have heard of black powder, also called "gun powder", but few know the difference between this and the current powder used in modern firearms (modern being post-1900s for the most part). 

Black powder is a chemical propellant that is (surprise surprise) black. It is generally pretty coarse, and when it is ignited (burns), it produces a lot of smoke. Like a lot of smoke.

The local indoor range I frequent requires that I call ahead so they can make sure the a bay of ranges is free for me to use because of the amount of smoke the revolver produces on each shot.

I highly recommend popping over to YouTube and looking up "Black Powder Revolvers" and check out some videos of people shooting thier revolvers. You will see the amount of smoke one shot makes.

Now granted, the amount of smoke from a revolver is quite a lot, but the most smoke comes from my Kentucky rifled musket. This typically takes a charge (amount of black powder) roughly 3 times that of the revolver. It makes a satisfying boom (not a bang like a modern rifle) and loads of smoke that goes everywhere. A ton of fun, and one of the only legal ways to own a 50 caliber (0.5 inch diameter bullet) in California.

Modern Smokeless powder is a lot cleaner (less smoke) and far more powerful than black powder. The only smokeless firearm I own at the moment is the double barrel shotgun.

## Safety
Despite my guns being of an older vintage, doesn't mean they aren't as dangerous as modern firearms. Both the revolvers have been compared ballistically to 45ACP, a powerful modern handgun round. With that, it means I _must_ treat these weapons of war with respect, as I would when handling any firearm. Firearm safety rule #1 is to always, always assume the weapon is loaded, no matter how sure you may be that it is clear.

Rule #2, stemming from #1, never point it at someone or something you are unwilling to shoot.

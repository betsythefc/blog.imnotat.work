I've been thinking about ways to broach the subject of firearms on this blog. There is a lot of political charge around guns, especially recently, and I don't really want to make these posts about politics or idealogies. 

As liberal as I am, I do enjoy firearms and heavily support _smart_ gun regulations. With that, let's dig into the kinds of firearms I own and prefer.

## Antiques
I currently own 5 guns.
- Kentucky Rifled Musket (Kit from 'Traditions')
- 1858 Remington Revolver (New Army)
- 1851 Colt Revolver (Navy)
- 1893 Belgium double barrel shotgun
- 1878 Vetterli, a surplus Swiss military rifle.

Of these 5, I have shot the 1858 revolver the most, and there is something about antique firearms, specifically from the 19th century through The Great War (World War 1), that I always have found incredibly fascinating and very fun to shoot.

## Black Powder
Most people have heard of black powder, also called "gun powder", but few know the difference between this and the current powder used in modern firearms (modern being post-1900s for the most part). 

Black powder is a chemical propellant that is (surprise surprise) black. It is generally pretty coarse, and when it is ignited (burns), it produces a lot of smoke. Like a lot of smoke.

The local indoor range I frequent requires that I call ahead so they can make sure the a bay of ranges is free for me to use because of the amount of smoke the revolver produces on each shot.

I highly recommend popping over to YouTube and looking up "Black Powder Revolvers" and check out some videos of people shooting thier revolvers. You will see the amount of smoke one shot makes.

Now granted, the amount of smoke from a revolver is quite a lot, but the most smoke comes from my Kentucky rifled musket. This typically takes a charge (amount of black powder) roughly 3 times that of the revolver. It makes a satisfying boom (not a bang like a modern rifle) and loads of smoke that goes everywhere. A ton of fun, and one of the only legal ways to own a 50 caliber (0.5 inch diameter bullet) in California.

Modern Smokeless powder is a lot cleaner (less smoke) and far more powerful than black powder. The only smokeless firearm I own at the moment is the double barrel shotgun.

## Safety
Like all firearms, safety is first and foremost. There is NO excuse for being lax on safety with any firearm, no matter how "old" they may be. They are still explosive-powered weapons of war. 

With any weapon in general, whether it be guns, blades or whatever you own, please be very safe.

## Last word
From here on out, I will be posting pictures and "range reports" where I post pictures of my accuracy and score (on the target), other interesting firearms I find, and some of the side projects relating to firearms that I run. My hope is to ease a bit of the fear around firearms but also to show how they are useful tools, some of the fallacies around firearm ownership, and how to be safe and have fun.

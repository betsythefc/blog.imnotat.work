# The Senate
I'm not a big fan of talking politics, but of course with this recent election, and the republican dominated house and senate, there are some very concerning policies coming up that will damage many things from privacy to healthcare. 

> [ISP now stands for "invading subscriber privacy," Democratic senator says.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/senate-votes-to-let-isps-sell-your-web-browsing-history-to-advertisers/)

The US Senate has now voted to allow ISPs (Internet Service Providers, ie AT&T, Comcast, etc) to monitor, collect, and sell - to the highest bidder (yay capitalism) - your internet browsing history.

For some basics on this, let's explain a bit about browser histories, for those are aren't that technically inclined. If you have never looked at your browsers history to get that one website you visited 2 weeks ago, then you may not know this, but every major web browser keeps a list of what websites you visit. This is mostly for your conveniance. However, this list is indirectly accessible from your ISP, because every website you visit is sent across your ISPs network, and because of how DNS (Domain Name Service) works (translating www.google.com to an IP address), even your traffic over _https://_ is saved.

If this bill passes the house, ISPs will be granted a new revenue stream, by selling that long list of every website you visit (including sites with sensitive medical and banking information, and of course all of the sites you may visit that qualify as "Not Safe For Work") to advertisers. This also means, for you more _tinfloilies_ out there, that this list will be even more readily available to state actors, like governments. 

As a _heavy_ privacy and security advocate, I am very, very worried and angry that this has been allowed to pass, though not altogether surprised. When you are owned by some of the most powerful, wealthiest, and worst rated companies in the US, you tend to do what they want; they do line your pockets.

## Anger

Now I am very _pissed_ at this. It is hard to tell you how much anger I have towards groups that actively fight the privacy of individuals, no matter the reason. And this is another blatant attempt to continue making a state of constant surveillance. We must always continue fighting these types of regulations and always favor the privacy of the private citizen over the profits of the public companies.

# But there is hope

Alas, there is something you can do! The [EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation)](https://www.eff.org) is an organization dedicated to supporting digital security and privacy online. I would highly recomend that you read their [article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy) on the subject, donate to the EFF, and contact the [house representatives](https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy) to tell them to put a stop to this measure.

I am a few days late to the "party", but I wanted to do a follow up after a bit of research. As anyone who is interested in privacy and security in the digital age will know, S. J. RES. 34 (Senate Joint Resolution #34) passed the house riding solely on the GOP majority. 

This is a big federal knockout against privacy as it solidifies the current state of ISP monetization of consumer data, however, I have learned that this won't change all too much in day-to-day life, as the rules put in place by the FCC were already on hold by order of Congress' pending review. This does not mean we should forget about this of course. There are some things that you can do to help mitigate the risk:

+ If possible, switch to an ISP that protects your data. Where I live, I am lucky enough to have the options.

+ Contact your state representatives and urge them to put forth a bill in the state legislature protecting consumer privacy. The above resolution only stops the FCC from regulating privacy to ISPs, it does not explicitly give ISPs the right to do so.

+ If neither of those work out, try setting up your router to connect to a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or route all traffic through [tor (The Onion Router)](https://torproject.org). This way all devices' traffic will be protected from the prying eyes of your evil ISP.

+ Contact your ISP to confirm whether or not they will be acting on this removal of regulations. Read their privacy policy and terms of service very carefully.

Things of this nature are not for everyone because every one of the options I listed is time consuming or technically difficult with some serious user experience downsides (like speed).

I plan to keep up to date on this issue and post more articles (hopefully the happier kind that gives people their privacy back).

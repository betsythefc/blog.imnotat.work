# The Bill
S. J. RES. 34 (Senate Joint Resolution #34) is the bill put forth by the Senate that would restrice the power of the FCC and allow ISP (Internet Service Providers) the freedom to monitor, collect, store and sell all of your browsing history. I wanted to write a quick rundown of what this bill does, and emphasize some of the terrible repercussions it will have.

# Into the weeds
[S. J. RES. 34](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/34/text) is an incredicly short resolution that invokes [Chapter 8 of Title 5 of the US code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-8) to disapprove of the FCC ruling relating to "Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services". This is a lot of jargon to most, even me when I read it. Here is the full wording of the resolution:

>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to “Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services” (81 Fed. Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.

Thats it. That is the entire resolution, so let's break it down to the important line.

>That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission

Congress doesn't like the rule, and wants it removed from active law.

>relating to “[Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-02/pdf/2016-28006.pdf)”

This is congress trying to remove this rule, and most people have been focusing on Subpart U, section n (Page 70):

>##Subpart U—Protecting Customer Information
>...
>(n) 
>Sensitive customer proprietary 
>information. 
>The terms ‘‘sensitive 
>customer proprietary information’’ or 
>‘‘sensitive customer PI’’ include: 
>(1) Financial information; 
>(2) Health information; 
>(3) Information pertaining to children; 
>(4) Social Security numbers; 
>(5) Precise geo-location information; 
>(6) Content of communications; 
>(7) Call detail information; and 
>(8) Web browsing history, application 
>usage history, and the functional 
>equivalents of either.

These definitions are very important to the US public, as it now means that ISPs can monitor, collect, store and sell all of the above information, without your consent, to anybody they like (most likely marketing firms, but also state actors).

This resolution would nullify [81 Fed. Reg. 87274](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-02/pdf/2016-28006.pdf) (The PDF above), and open up ISPs to add another revenue stream to their portfolio. One of the arguments I have heard is that this will lower the cost of internet service to everyone, as the ISPs will have more income. I think this is pretty obviously incorrect, as ISPs have been gouging customers for years to increase profits. I think we will see no change to current internet access costs, and massive revenues for ISPs.

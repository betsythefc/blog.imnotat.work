# What is chronic pain?
Chronic pain can come in so many forms. Believe it or not, there is an exact time line to when doctors determine whether pain is chronic or acute, (lifelong or ending in a short period of time). Acute pain is pain felt when someone breaks a bone or sprains a joint. These are situations in which people explain acute pain. Chronic pain is pain that lasts more than six months. This is a different kind of pain. This is pain that can be managed by multiple routes such as physical therapy, medication, yoga, stretching, and much more. The reality of it is that it is chronic which means lifelong!

# Understanding Chronic Pain

## Activity
Those with chronic pain cannot be as active as we once were. Something as simple as reaching for an object can seem like a really difficult task. We try to hide the pain or ignore it, but in reality, we live through it. On average days, some who live with chronic pain find comfort in doing yoga, meditation, walking, or light exercise. On extra good days, they might take a short jog. When the bad days hit, they can hit hard which can result in little to no activity. The domino effect can take place. On these days, the effect of little to no activity can change our moods, significantly.

## Mood
Chronic pain makes us cranky. That’s just the reality of it. Being in pain effects are mood. From the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep. The frustration that we need to be critical of every move that we make throughout our day. The pain affects the way we talk to others, the way we perceive actions, and the way we experience actions. And the math is easy. The more pain we are in, the more likely we will “see red” throughout the day, and that can disrupt our relationships.

## Relationships
One of the many lovely side effects of chronic pain is, you guessed it, ignorance. Chronic pain is usually not visible. Therefore, it is difficult for others to feel the sympathy, empathy, or understanding towards people who are experiencing chronic pain. This can be truly disruptive to relationships. Some people living with chronic pain live an isolated life because of how disruptive this can be. Not to mention how difficult it is to ask for help. It may not seem like a difficult task, but it is difficult to someone who is used to hiding their pain from the world for a long time. Breaking that barrier is very hard for someone. My advise to someone who has a friend with chronic pain is to ask them if they need help, be open and accepting, and give them a shoulder, because you know what? We need it more than we can say!

# The Reality: My Story
When I was just twelve years old, I fell hard in a track and field practice at school. After I fell, I got up and walked the six blocks home, not knowing what it would do. That was the event that started my pain. Four years of painful living later, the doctors discovered that I had a condition called _spondylolisthesis_. This is when one of the vertebrae in the spine begins to release from the others and slide out. It was greatly affecting my involvement in extracurricular activities. The doctors decided that it was time for surgery to fuse the two vertebrae together to stop the slide. I was going to miss three months of school and had a six month to one year recovery. So, I went through with it, and here I am five years later, and still in pain.

The pain affects my activity greatly. It’s difficult to work, sit for more than 20 minutes, exercise, attend social events, etc. This is the definition of frustration. So, when someone asks me what it is like to live with chronic pain, I say:

>Having chronic pain means having to plan your day accordingly and have many “what if” scenarios covered. It means having to pack extra water and extra medication. It means being best friends with my back brace. It means having to wiggle around in class until comfortable (if I ever get to that point). Having chronic pain means having to make time for extra doctor appointments and having great health insurance. It means having multiple sources of heat and ice readily available.

>Chronic pain means having the energy to bounce of the walls and yet trapped in bed causing a multitude of mental health issues. It means feeling helpless, lost, or robbed of your ability. It means bringing my service animal everywhere. It means being stared at while I’m limping.

Living with chronic pain means that being in a loving relationship is hard because we often feel like a burden. Because it means that it’s necessary to be with someone who can help even when we can’t tell them. Someone who will try to understand what you are going through, who will run and get the Oxycodone when you are struggling to get out of bed. Someone who can go to the store for us, go to the pharmacy, help us get dressed. Because despite what we may say, we need help. And this is the reality of living the chronic pain life.
